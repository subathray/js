       2. while comparing in == typecasting occurs

    === 1.compares both value and data type
            if(1 === "1") //false

            if(true === "true") //false

        2. while comparing in === typecasting does not occurs.

     }
     arrow function
     multiline string
     promise
     destructuring 

11. What are the differnce between let,const,var?
    var:
        stores in window object
        can redeclare
        can reassign
        supports hoisting
        functional scope
    
    let:
        doesnt stores in window object
        cannot redeclare
        can reassign
        doesnt supports hoisting
        block scope

    const:
        doesnt stores in window object
        cannot redeclare
        cannot reassign
        doesnt supports hoisting
        block scope

12. What are the ways to empty an array?

    fruitArr = []; //empty array

13.What are the difference between break and continue?

    All the declarations of  variables and functions will be moved to the top of its scope while compling. It is called hoisting

20.What is strict mode?
    It is introduced in ES5(2009) 
    Strict mode makes it easier to write secure code.
    Strict mode eliminates javascript silent errors
    Strict mode is declared by adding "use strict" to the beginning of code
        Ex:
            use strict
            console.log(a); // throws error
            var a;
            delete a; // throws error
            var test = function (a, a) // throws error 
    1.using variable without declaring it, is not allowed
    2.deleting a variable or function is not allowed
    3.duplicating a parameter name is not allowed

21. How to convert string to a number?

            The bind will return a function

    call() -It is used to change the value of this keyword
            we can bind a function in an object with another object 
            It doesnt return a function.
            The call() method takes arguments separately.

    apply()-It is used to change the value of this keyword
            we can bind a function in an object with another object
            It doesnt return a function.
            The apply() method takes arguments as an array.
